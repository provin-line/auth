/**
 * Graceful shutdown for the generated instance.
 *
 * ## Why this is in the scaffold rather than a dependency
 *
 * It used to be `gracefulShutdown` from `@o3co/auth.utils@0.0.4`. For the
 * component that terminates every user session, "does SIGTERM wait for
 * in-flight requests, and for how long?" has to be answerable from the code
 * an operator deploys — and reading those 22 lines answered it badly:
 * **there was no deadline**. `server.close()` waits indefinitely, so one stuck
 * request meant the process never exited on its own and the orchestrator's
 * SIGKILL took it down mid-flight, precisely under the load that produces a
 * stuck request. Cleanup failures went to `console.error`, and every exit was
 * zero, so a truncated shutdown looked exactly like a clean one.
 *
 * auth.provider (#290), auth.proxy (#81) and auth.policy-verifier (#210) each
 * moved the behaviour into the code they ship. This is the same contract.
 *
 * ## The guarantees, stated
 *
 * 1. **SIGTERM and SIGINT** both start it; a second signal is ignored.
 * 2. **New connections stop immediately** (`close`) and idle keep-alive
 *    sockets are released (`closeIdleConnections`).
 * 3. **In-flight requests get `drainTimeoutMs`** (default 10s) to finish.
 * 4. **Past the deadline, remaining connections are cut** and the process
 *    exits **non-zero**, so a truncated drain is distinguishable from a clean one.
 * 5. **`cleanup` runs after draining, before exit**, bounded by
 *    `cleanupTimeoutMs`; its failure is logged and reflected in the exit code.
 * 6. **A `close` that fails is not reported as a clean drain.**
 *
 * Size `drainTimeoutMs` and `cleanupTimeoutMs` together **below** the
 * orchestrator's kill grace period (Kubernetes
 * `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, compose `stop_grace_period`, both 30s by
 * default): the worst case is the two budgets in sequence.
